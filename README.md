# Nim-Food-Order

A simple food ordering menu written in Nim. It is not pretty but it works. I wanted to learn more about Nim and how to write in it. This was a fun task. I will clean the code up over time and add features.

## Compilation Steps

_Windows_
`nim.exe c --run .\food.nim`

_Linux or Mac_
`nim c --run food.nim`
